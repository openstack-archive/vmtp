This is for VMTP scale testing
This is work in progress for now
The idea is to be able to 
1. Create tenant and users to load the cloud
2. Create routers within a User in a tenant
3. Create N networks per router
4. Create N VMs per network
5. Clean up all resources by default (Provide ability to avoid cleanup)
