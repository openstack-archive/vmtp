Contribute to VMTP
------------------

Below are a simplified version of the workflow to work on VMTP. For complete instructions, you have to follow the Developer's Guide in OpenStack official documents. Refer to :ref:`below section <developer_guide_of_openstack>` for links.


Start working
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before starting, a GitHub/StackForge respository based installation must be done. Refer :ref:`here <git_installation>` for detailed documentation.

1. From the root of your workspace, check out a new branch to work on::

    $ git checkout -b <TOPIC-BRANCH>

2. Happy working on your code for features or bugfixes;


Before Commit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are some criteria that are enforced to commit to VMTP. Below commands will perform the check and make sure your code complys with it.

3. PEP 8::

    $ tox -epep8

**Note:** The first run usually takes longer, as tox will create a new virtual environment and download all dependencies. Once that is the done, further run will be very fast.

4. Run the test suite::

    $ tox -epython27

5. If you made a documentation change (i.e. changes to .rst files), make sure the documentation is built as you expected::

    $ cd <vmtp-ws-root>/doc
    $ make html

Once finished, the documentation in HTML format will be ready at <vmtp-ws-root>/doc/build/html.


Submit Review
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

6. Commit the code::

    $ git commit -a

**Note:** For a feature commit, please supply a clear commit message indicating what the feature is; for a bugfix commit, please also containing a launchpad link to the bug you are working on.

7. Submit the review::

    $ git review

The members in the VMTP team will get notified once the Jenkin verification is passed. So watch your email from the review site, as it will contain the updates for your submission.

8. If the code is approved with a +2 review, Gerrit will automatically merge your code.


File Bugs
---------

Bugs should be filed on Launchpad, not GitHub:

   https://bugs.launchpad.net/vmtp


Build VMTP Docker Image
-----------------------

Two files are used to build the Docker image: *Dockerfile* and *.dockerignore*. The former provides all the build instructions while the latter provides the list of files/directories that should not be copied to the Docker image.

In order to make the Docker image clean, remove all auto generated files from the root of your workspace first. It is strongly recommeneded to simply pull a new one from GitHub/StackForge. Specify the image name and the tag, and feed them to docker build. Examples to build the image with name "$USER/vmtp", tag "2.0.0" and "latest"::

    $ cd <vmtp-ws-root>
    $ sudo docker build --tag=$USER/vmtp:2.0.0 .
    $ sudo docker build --tag=$USER/vmtp:latest .

The images should be available for use::

    $ sudo docker images
    REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             VIRTUAL SIZE
    ahothan/vmtp        2.0.0               9f08056496d7        27 hours ago        494.6 MB
    ahothan/vmtp        latest              9f08056496d7        27 hours ago        494.6 MB

For exchanging purposes, the image could be saved to a tar archive. You can distribute the VMTP Docker image among your servers easily with this feature::

    $ sudo docker save <IMAGE_ID> -o <IMAGE_FILE>

To publish the image to Docker Hub::

    $ sudo docker login
    $ sudo docker push $USER/vmtp:2.0.0
    $ sudo docker push $USER/vmtp:latest
